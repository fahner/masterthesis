\chapter{Normalisation fit}
\label{sec:Normalisationfit}

This chapter describes the analysis of the normalisation channel \LbToLcmunu resulting in the signal yield \NLc for the calculation of \R. The method is different to the one in the signal channel \LbToDpmunuX due to several reasons:
The final state particles of the subdecay \LcTopKpi are all reconstructed. 
It is thus possible to see a clear \Lc mass peak as shown in figure \ref{fig:plot_Lc_M}.
The small sidebands indicate a small combinatorial background concerning the subdecay \LcTopKpi.
Background coming from a random combination of a \Lc with a muon can be estimated by a look at the WS final states combinations \Lc\mup.
Since a \Lb can't decay into a \Lc\mup due to charge conservation, this unphysical combination gives a good hint for randomly combined \Lc\mun.
The second reason why a different method is chosen compared to the \LbToDpmunuX channel is the fact that the \Lb can decay in several excited \Lc states (in the following denoted as \Lcstar for any excited \Lc state).
It has been shown in \ref{SL_Vub} that the \LbToLcmunu data is saturated by the decays \decay{\Lb}{\LcstarRes{(2595)}\mun\neumb} and \decay{\Lb}{\LcstarRes{(2625)}\mun\neumb}.
These excited \Lcstar instantly decay for instance in \Lc\pip\pim. 
If these two pions aren't reconstructed, this decay can't be distinguished by its topology.
That's why a different approach for the determination of \NLc has to be chosen.
The solution of the latter problem is to fit the
