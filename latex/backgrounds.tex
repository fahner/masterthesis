\chapter{Backgrounds}
\label{sec:Backgrounds}
The big disadvantage of semileptonic decays is that the neutrino cannot be reconstructed.
At hadron colliders like the \lhc, it is impossible to know the kinematics of the initial state, so one does not have enough constraints to reconstruct the full kinematic information about the decaying particle.
Being aware of these problems due to the experimental setup it is clear that one cannot use a well reconstructed \Lb mass peak to separate signal from background.
A main source of background is expected to be the decay \decay{\Bd/\Bp}{\Dz\mun\neumb X} where one randomly combines a proton to this decay.
This background is handled by the fit of the \logIP distribution.
Other sources of backgrounds and their possible impact on the obtained signal yield \NDp are discussed in the following.
For the \LbToLcmunu channel it is assumed, that all non-negligible backgrounds are accounted for due to the sideband-subtraction and including wrong sign events as well as resonant mode components in the fit.
Thus, the discussion in this chapter refers completely to the \LbToDpmunuX channel.

\section{Proton misidentification}
\label{sec:BKG_misIDp}
A possible source of backgrounds is that one misinterprets a decay as \LbToDpmunuX if one misidentifies a final state particle.
In this analysis it is most likely that the proton is fake since the final state pion and kaon are reconstructed to a \Dz yielding in a nice peak and the muon leaves a clear signature in the detector due to its relatively long lifetime and low interaction with matter.
Examples for these kind of backgrounds are the decays \decay{\Bs}{\Dz\Kp\mun\neumb X} and \decay{\Bd/\Bp}{\Dz\pip\mun\neumb X}, where either the \Kp or \pip is misidentified as proton.
Though there are tight requirements on the proton identification at selection stage, the data is still polluted by misidentified particles.
To identify the amount of misidentified protons, a slightly different data sample than the nominal one is used. 
In this sample no requirements on the proton idenfication are applied.
All other requirements are the same as described in Section \ref{sec:Selection}.
However the removal of the particle identification requirements for the protons lets the data size of the sample rapidly increase.
To keep the data size acceptable a so called 5\% prescaling has been applied, i.e. only 5\% of all events are actually stored.
The decision if a particle is stored or not is made by random.
That is why absolute numbers quoted in this section cannot be compared to the obtained signal yields etc. in the previous sections.
The study on misidentified backgrounds is done in three steps.

\subsection{Definition of particle identification regions - Number of particle candidates}
\label{sec:PIDCalib_Ncand}
As a first step, it has to be defined what requirements have to be fulfilled, that a particle is called a proton, pion or kaon.
For that purpose, the PID (for Particle IDentification) variables are used.
Remember, that \lhcb's particle identification system provides likelihoods for each particle hypothesis.
The PID variables now describe differences between the logarithms of these likelihoods, e.g. PIDp is defined as the difference of the logarithmic likelihoods between the proton and pion hypothesis.
A value of PIDp $>0$ hence means, that the particle is more likely a proton than a pion.
Respectively, the PIDK compares kaon to pion hypothesis.
If one wants to separate protons from kaons it is useful to look at PIDp$-$PIDK.
The definition what will be called proton is motivated by the requirements applied in the analysis (see section \ref{sec:Selection}). 
In detail the regions for the identification of protons, pions and kaons are:
\input{includes/settings_regions}

Furthermore these regions and their population are visualised in Figure \ref{fig:PIDregions}. 
From this, the number of candidates for each particle species is obtained, in the following denoted as \Ncand{i}, with $i \in \left[\pi, \kaon, \proton\right]$. 
The number of candidates are
\begin{align}
    \Ncand{\pi}     &= \PIDNcandpionval \pm \PIDNcandpionerr, \\ 
    \Ncand{\kaon}   &= \PIDNcandkaonval \pm \PIDNcandkaonerr, \\ 
    \Ncand{\proton} &= \PIDNcandprotonval \pm \PIDNcandprotonerr.
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[tb]

	\caption{Defined regions for the number of particle candidates.
             Events in black are defined as protons, red as kaons and blue as pions.}
	\label{fig:PIDregions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Determination of ``true" candidates with PID efficiencies}
This choice of regions is a bit arbitrary and it does not prevent real protons, pions and kaons to enter the other regions.
With the PID variables it is only possible to increase or decrease the probability, that a particle enters a ``foreign" region.
Thus, one needs to determine the efficiencies that a real proton, pion or kaon passes the requirements for the identification of being a proton, kaon or pion.
For this purpose the \lhcb PIDcalib tool is used \cite{PIDcalib}.
This tool includes calibration samples of decays, cleanly reconstructed without use of the PID variables. 
For instance one uses the decay \decay{\Lambda}{\proton\pim} for the determination of proton efficiencies.
Since no requirement on the PID has been applied before, it is now possible to study the impact of these requirements.
The PID efficiency for each of the 9 possible combinations (real particle to be identified as other particle according to PID) is determined binwise depending on the particle momentum. 
The results can be seen in figure \ref{fig:PIDefficiencies}.
The left figure clearly shows that pions and kaons hardly fulfil the tight requirements PIDp $>10$ and PIDp$-$PIDK $>10$ made on the proton identification in the reconstruction of \LbToDpmunuX and \LbToLcmunu.
Only, if they have a momentum of about $20 \gev$ there is a little chance to pass the selection.
\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{LbToD0p/PID/PID_proton}

	\caption{Efficiencies that real protons, kaons and pions are identified as protons (left), kaons (middle) or pions (right). The tight requirements on the proton PID applied in this analysis ensures that only few kaons and pions enter the proton region paying the prize, that one looses a lot of
    protons as well.}
	\label{fig:PIDefficiencies}
\end{figure}
To determine a final value for each identification efficiency and to account for differences in the kinematics between the decays of the test samples and the \LbToDpmunuX decay, the histograms are weighted with respect to the kinematic distribution of the \LbToDpmunuX data.
The result is:
\input{includes/result_PID_efficiencies}
Here, \effPID{i}{j} denotes the efficiency, that a real (true) particle $i$ is identified as what is callied $j$ according to the particle regions defined in section \ref{sec:PIDCalib_Ncand}. 
For the following steps, PID efficiency errors are assumed to be negligible compared to the corresponding uncertainties of the particle candidates \Ncand{i}.
With the PID efficiencies \effPID{i}{j} and the number of particle candidates \Ncand{k}, the number of real (true) particles can now be estimated by solving the matrix equation
\begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        \Ncand{\pi} \\ \Ncand{\kaon} \\ \Ncand{\proton}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
       \effPID{\pi}{\pi}     & \effPID{\kaon}{\pi}     & \effPID{\proton}{\pi} \\
       \effPID{\pi}{\kaon}   & \effPID{\kaon}{\kaon}   & \effPID{\proton}{\kaon} \\
       \effPID{\pi}{\proton} & \effPID{\kaon}{\proton} & \effPID{\proton}{\proton} 
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        \Ntrue{\pi} \\ \Ntrue{\kaon} \\ \Ntrue{\proton }
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Assuming that the efficiency matrix is invertible, one obtains
\begin{align}
    \Ntrue{\pi}     &= \PIDNtruepionval \pm \PIDNtruepionerr, \\ 
    \Ntrue{\kaon}   &= \PIDNtruekaonval \pm \PIDNtruekaonerr, \\ 
    \Ntrue{\proton} &= \PIDNtrueprotonval \pm \PIDNtrueprotonerr.
\end{align}
\Ntrue{i} denotes the number of real particles $i$ in the sample.

\subsection{Estimate of misidentified protons}
Using the results of the previous subsections it is now possible to estimate the number of misidentified protons, i.e. ``true" kaons or pions entering the proton region.
This is calculated by multiplying the number of ``true" particles \Ntrue{i} with the PID efficiency \effPID{i}{\proton} to be identified as proton. 
\begin{align}
    N^{\pi}     &= \effPID{\pi}{\proton} \Ntrue{\pi}         = \PIDNtruePregionpionval \pm \PIDNtruePregionpionerr, \\  
    N^{\kaon}   &= \effPID{\kaon}{\proton} \Ntrue{\kaon}     = \PIDNtruePregionkaonval \pm \PIDNtruePregionkaonerr, \\ 
    N^{\proton} &= \effPID{\proton}{\proton} \Ntrue{\proton} = \PIDNtruePregionprotonval \pm \PIDNtruePregionprotonerr.
\end{align}
Thus, the amount of misidentified protons is at a single-digit percent level, namely $(\misIDratioval \pm \misIDratioerr)\%$. 
Note again, that the absolute values cannot be compared to the signal yields obtained in previous parts of this analysis.
It is only the lastly quoted ratio which can be used in the following.

\section{Misidentified muons}
\label{sec:BKG_misIDmu}
Though not as prominent as misidentified protons, the misidentification of muons is also considered.
One possibility is that the muon is misidentified from an exclusive 3 body decay of the \Lb for instance \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton\pim}.
If this is the case, the decay is not semileptonic but rather hadronic.
Consequently, the \Lb can be fully reconstructed since all final state particles are seen.
This leads to a peak in the invariant \Dz\proton\mun around the \Lb mass.
There is indeed such a peak as figure \ref{fig:plot_D0pmuMass} shows.
Thus, this kind of backgrounds can be easily eliminated by vetoing \Dz\proton\muon masses around the \Lb mass, in this case all masses above 5500\mev.
\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{LbToD0p/plots/data/Bh_M}
	\caption{Invariant \Dz\proton\mun mass. A peak at \Lb mass ($\approx 5620 \mev$) can be seen caused by misidentified muons coming from hadronic decays like \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton\pi} where the pion is misidentified as muon. 
             A veto on the \Dz\proton\mun mass indicated by the arrow eliminates such backgrounds.}
	\label{fig:plot_D0pmuMass}
\end{figure}

The situation becomes more tricky, if the background is coming from a multi-body \Lb decay, i.e. a decay with more than 3 final state particles.
Since this analysis aims to measure the inclusive branching ratio \BR(\LbToDpmunuX), misidentified muons could also come from decays like \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton 3\pi}, where one of the 3 pions is misidentified as muon.
These backgrounds are not easy to eliminate, since the other 2 pions are not reconstructed and the decay is thus not peaking in \Dz\proton\mun mass.
Nonetheless if they are existent in the data sample it might be possible, that such backgrounds tend to sit at lower PIDmu of the muon saying the lower the PIDmu of a muon is the more likely it is to be a misidentified particle.
Unfortunately no distinct structures can be seen in figure \ref{fig:plot_D0pmuMass_vs_muPIDmu}.
This might be a hint that these backgrounds play a minor role.
Assuming that the decay \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton 3\pi} behaves in comparison to \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton\pim} similar to the meson decays \decay{\Bd}{\Dm 3\pi} and \decay{\Bd}{\Dm\pip} with 
$\BR(\decay{\Bd}{\Dm 3\pi}) = (2.76 \pm 0.13) \cdot 10^{-3} \approx$ 
$\BR(\decay{\Bd}{\Dm\pip}) = (2.68 \pm 0.13) \cdot 10^{-3}$ (see \cite{PDG})
they should have similar branching ratios and thus should equally leak as background into this analysis.
A comparison with $\BR(\decay{\Bd}{\Dm 3\pi})/\BR(\decay{\Bd}{\Dm\ellp\neul}) \approx 10\%$ and the misidentification probabilty of a hadron of less than $10\%$ \cite{muonID_Performance} justifies the assumption that this background leaks with about $1\%$ in the signal yield.
Furthermore, there are other possible but not yet measured peaking backgrounds such as \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton\rhom} or \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton\pim\rhoz}.
Since they have not been measured so far their contribution can only be guessed.
Starting from the $1\%$ contribution of \decay{\Lb}{\Dz\proton 3\pi} a conservative estimate of a total peaking background ratio of $(5.0 \pm 2.5)\%$ is assumed.
The large error accounts for the uncertainty in the estimate how many other decay channels and how strongly they contribute.

\end{figure}

\section{Prompt \Dz mesons}
With prompt \Dz one denotes \Dz mesons coming directly from the primary \proton\proton interaction, thus being not a product of other decaying particles.
The production of prompt \Dz is usually a lot higher than the production of \Lb baryons. 
Prompt \Dz can be mixed up with the \LbToDpmunuX if one adds a fake muon or a muon from another source and a proton e.g. from the primary interaction.
One typically measures a prompt \Dz background of about $1\%$ in semileptonic \bquark-hadron decays \cite{asld_LHCb}.
As cross-check, the logarithm of the \Dz impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex is drawn.
Prompt \Dz should have a smaller impact parameter compared to \Dz coming from the \Lb decay.
This should become more clearly visible in wrong sign combinations with respect to the right sign data.
However, Figure \ref{fig:plot_D0_IP} does not show any discrepancies between data and wrong sign combinations, which would indicate the influence of prompt \Dz backgrounds.
Furthermore one requires in the reconstruction process that the \Dz candidate is combined with a \mun and a \proton to form a \Lb candidate at a secondary vertex displaced from the primary interaction.
Thus, it seems that the selection requirements in the reconstruction process suppresses the prompt \Dz background to an negligible amount compared to other backgrounds.

	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{LbToD0p/plots/data/D0_IP_OWNPV}
	\caption{Logarithm of the \Dz impact parameter with respect to the primary \proton\proton interaction. No special behaviour of the wrong sign combinations indicating an enhancement of prompt \Dz background can be seen.}
	\label{fig:plot_D0_IP}
\end{figure}

\section{Other possible backgrounds}
In this section some possible backgrounds not being studied in this analysis are mentioned.
Some of these decays have not been measured or seen so far but should be possible.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow \Dm \Lc$: \\
          This decay has not been measured yet.
          It fakes to be signal, if the kaon of \LcTopKpi is misidentified as muon.
    \item $\Lambda_b^0 \rightarrow D^0 D^- p$: \\
          This decay has not been measured yet.
          For semileptonic $\Dm \rightarrow \mun X$ decays, where one misses the $X$ this channel mimics to be \LbToDpmunuX signal.
    \item prompt \LcResI or \LcResII decays with a randomly combined \mun: \\
          This background should be reduced by requiring the \LcResI resp. \LcResII vertex to be well separated from the PV as done by the combination with a muon to make a \Lb candidate.
\end{itemize}
Since the two \Lb decays mentioned above have not been measured yet, it is hard to estimate their contribution.
To account for these backgrounds, it is assumed that the conservative estimate in Section \ref{sec:BKG_misIDmu} with an uncertainty of $2.5\%$ covers them as well.

\section{Backgrounds summary and estimate of background yield}
The largest background contributions leaking into the signal yield \NDp obtained by the two-dimensional fit are discussed to come from either misidentified protons or muons.
All other backgrounds seem to be negligible compared to the latter ones or are included in a conservative estimate with a large uncertainty.
Adding them up leads to a total ratio of background events in the signal yield of $(\NDpBKGratioval \pm \NDpBKGratioerr)\%$.
This corresponds to a number of background events of 
\begin{align*}
    \NBgdDp = \NDpBKGval \pm \NDpBKGerr.
\end{align*}
Note that the error on the background ratio will be assigned as the systematic uncertainty.
