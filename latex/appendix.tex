\chapter{Mass resolution}
\label{app:Massresolution}
Figure \ref{fig:massresolution_all} shows the fits to all bins of \Dz\proton mass for the determination of the mass resolution.
The whole method and prodecure is described in Section \ref{sec:Massresolution}.

\chapter{Reweighting of \LbToDpmunuX decay simulation}
\label{app:Reweight_D0p}
Figure \ref{fig:reweight_D0p_app} shows several more comparisons of data and simulation before and after reweighting.
More on the reweighting process can be found in Section \ref{sec:Reweight_D0p}.

\chapter{Reweighting and comparison of the \LbToLcmunu candidates}
\label{app:Reweight_Lc}
Except for the kinematic \pt(\Lb) reweighting, no additional reweighting is applied as for \LbToDpmunu. 
However, the data is polluted by two decays into excited states, \decay{\Lb}{\LcstarRes{(2593)}\mun\neumb} and \decay{\Lb}{\LcstarRes{(2625)}\neumb}. 
Thus, Figure \ref{fig:reweight_Lc_app} shows a comparison of side bandsubtracted data and the sum of the three different channels.
They are summed up according to the yields obtained by the fit to the corrected \Lb mass in Section \ref{sec:Normalisationfit}.
