\chapter{Massresolution}
Figure \ref{fig:massresolution_all} shows the fits to all bins of \Dz\proton mass for the determination of the massresolution.
The whole method and prodecure is described in section \ref{sec:Massresolution}.

\chapter{Reweighting of \LbToDpmunuX decay simulation}
\label{app:Reweight_D0p}
Figure \ref{fig:reweight_D0p_app} shows several more comparisons of data and simulation before and after reweighting.
More on the reweighting process can be found in section \ref{sec:Reweight_D0p}.
